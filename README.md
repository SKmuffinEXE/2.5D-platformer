# 2.5D-platformer

A 2.5D platforming game I made when I was in college.  Open the file "2nd.exe" to open the 2nd version I made of the project.

The project focuses on the ability to "job change" where the player can switch classes freely between knight, mage and thief.  To do so, the player hits either 1, 2 or 3 to change to
the desired class.

As of now in this prototype, there are issues with the camera losing track of the player, and that mage outranges most of the enemies on the map, while thief can simply
jump over enemies without them trying to stop him.
